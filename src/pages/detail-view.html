          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            The Avengers are a legendary team of superheroes assembled by
            S.H.I.E.L.D. to protect the Earth from powerful and unpredictable
            threats. Originally formed by iconic heroes like Iron Man, Captain
            America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow, and Hawkeye, the team has grown
            over time to include characters such as Spider-Man, Black Panther,
            Doctor Strange, Scarlet Witch, and many more. Despite their
            individual differences, they unite when the world needs them most.
          </p>

          <h3>Legacy of Heroes</h3>
          <p>
            The Avengers are more than just a team; they are a legacy of heroism
            that spans generations. Their battles against foes like Loki,
            Ultron, and Thanos have proven that unity is their greatest
            strength.
          </p>

          <h3>Guardians of Tomorrow</h3>
          <p>
            United by fate and driven by duty, the Avengers are Earth's greatest
            defenders. Their influence spans the globe and even the cosmos.
