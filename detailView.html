          <h3>Poster Avengers</h3>
          <p>The Avengers are a legendary team of superheroes assembled by S.H.I.E.L.D. to protect the Earth from powerful and unpredictable threats.
             Originally formed by iconic heroes like Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow, and Hawkeye,
             the team has grown over time to include characters such as Spider-Man, Black Panther, Doctor Strange, Scarlet Witch, and many more.
             Known for their courage, dedication, and extraordinary abilities, the Avengers face enemies ranging from alien invasions and rogue
             artificial intelligence to mystical threats and intergalactic warlords. Despite their individual differences, personal struggles,
             and clashing egos, the Avengers always unite when the world needs them most. Their greatest challenge came with Thanos, a ruthless
             titan obsessed with collecting all six Infinity Stones to wipe out half of all life in the universe. Through perseverance, sacrifice,
             and teamwork, the Avengers managed to overcome even the darkest of times. They remain a symbol of hope, resilience, and heroism, proving
             time and again that unity is their greatest strength.</p>
